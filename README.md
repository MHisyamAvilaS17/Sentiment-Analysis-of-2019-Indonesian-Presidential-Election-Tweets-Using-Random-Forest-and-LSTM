# Sentiment-Analysis-of-2019-Indonesian-Presidential-Election-Tweets-Using-Random-Forest-and-LSTM
This project analyzes public sentiment on the 2019 Indonesian Presidential Election using Random Forest and LSTM Algorithm. The dataset consists of tweets related to the election, which are processed through text preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF &amp; Word2Vec), and classification models.
ðŸš€ Key Features

1. Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

2. Feature Extraction: Implements TF-IDF and Word2Vec for vectorization.

3. Model Training: Uses Random Forest and LSTM with hyperparameter tuning.

4. Performance Evaluation: Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

5. Comparison: Analyzes the effectiveness of Random Forest vs LSTM in sentiment classification.
